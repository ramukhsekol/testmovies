For, Varun isn’t an idealist like Bharat. The first time we see him, he is partying like there’s no tomorrow. When he is told that he should take over as the chief minister, he remarks he doesn’t even know who the governor is. When the governor asks him about the portfolios of his ministers, he is clueless. And he needs someone else to dress him up in dhoti, that trademark costume of a politician.","movieImage":"https://3movierulz.vc/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nota-New-Image.jpg","movieYear":2018,"movieLinks":[{"movieLink":"https://openload.co/f/NpaV1paEXrA/"},{"movieLink":"https://goscr.co/?p=29721"},{"movieLink":"https://embedsr.co/?p=22520"},{"movieLink":"https://streamango.com/f/enqoobtssqtcfnbp/"},{"movieLink":"https://embedrip.co/?p=13393"},{"movieLink":"https://oneload.site/cwe3coxqvewx"},{"movieLink":"https://oload.fun/f/QlHA0zYxdts/"},{"movieLink":"https://vidoza.net/6maexu62rpw9.html"}]},{"id":5,"movieName":"Muddula Priyudu ","movieInfo":"Directed by: K.
